# Git-Workshop-Activity
- Get in groups of 2-3 people
- Have one person fork the repository and make it public.
- Have the person who forked the repository add the other people in the group as collaborators.
- Each group member should clone the repo.
- Divide up functions to implement: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide. 
- Each group member should now create a new branch and add their changes.
- After implementing their features, each group member should commit their changes and push to the remote repository they created.
- After all code is committed and pushed, each group member should retrieve the current version of the repo and merge the code onto the main branch.
- Test code by running Calculator.py
